Block excess outgoing deliveries in stock
=========================================
This module makes it impossible to scan more than the indicated quantities on
outgoing shipments that are destined for a customer location. If an excess
quantity is scanned or entered manually, an error is displayed and the scanned
amount is not incremented.
