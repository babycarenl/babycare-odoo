Lines are ordered, and colored as follows:
* lines with products that do not have a corresponding line in the current picking (Red)
* incomplete or overcomplete lines (Yellow)
* lines with products that have not yet been scanned (White)
* lines that are satisfied (Green)

TODO: unscanned products stay on top even if there are red and yellow lines.
