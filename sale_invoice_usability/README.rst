Sale invoice usability
======================
Record the invoice's sale order(s) on its refunds. Show all these invoices when
clicking on the sale order's 'View invoice' button. When creating a refund,
show other invoices (presumably existing refunds for the same invoice) if there
are any.

Only works for newly created refunds (after installation of this module).
